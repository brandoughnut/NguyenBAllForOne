Peer Review Comments: Overall you got the API data on the front end and the site overall has a nice theme to it so I would say good job. Got few issues with the assignment though that I'll categorize as easy fixes that I think you should do and annoying fixes that you can do it if you are feeling up for it

Easy fixes: You don't need to put placeholder text and your site would probably look better without it so I would delete that on each page

Annoying fixes: The alignments on the mobile are kinda weird, I would either use some sort of grid with the arrow button to get things looking nice or just have all the divs in one column. Font is a little small on mobile too, on my its too large but on yours I think it could be bigger just because there's not a whole text on the screen so it can take up more space.

Overall the color pallet was nice though and everything worked so I think you should get an A
